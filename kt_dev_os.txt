About

libsoup is an HTTP client/server library for GNOME. It uses GObjects and the glib main loop, to
integrate well with GNOME applications, and also has a synchronous API, for use in threaded
applications.

Features include:

    Both asynchronous (GMainLoop and callback-based) and synchronous APIs
    Automatically caches connections
    SSL Support using GnuTLS
    Proxy support, including authentication and SSL tunneling
    Client support for Digest, NTLM, and Basic authentication
    Server support for Digest and Basic authentication
    Client and server support for XML-RPC 

See the libsoup client-side HOWTO and libsoup server-side HOWTO for an introduction to using the
client and server APIs.

{soup-uri}
Includes

#include <libsoup/soup.h>

Description

A SoupURI represents a (parsed) URI.

Many applications will not need to use SoupURI directly at all; on the client side,
     soup_message_new() takes a stringified URI, and on the server side, the path and query
     components are provided for you in the server callback.
