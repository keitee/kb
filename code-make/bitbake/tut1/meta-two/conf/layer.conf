# 7.1. Adding an additional layer

BBPATH .= ":${LAYERDIR}"


# 8.2. bbappend files
# An append file can be use to add functions to an existing class without
# creating a new one.  It adds the text of the append file to a class with the
# same name.
# 
# To be able to use append files the layer needs to be set up to load also them
# in addition to normal recipes.  Therefore we change our layer configuration
# and add loading of *.bbappend file to the BBFILES variable.

# BBFILES += "${LAYERDIR}/recipes-*/*/*.bb"

BBFILES += "${LAYERDIR}/recipes-*/*/*.bb \
            ${LAYERDIR}/recipes-*/*/*/.bbappend"

# 7.3. Extending the layer configuration

# 7.4. Layer compatibility
# A project like yocto is composed out of very many layers. 
#
# To ensure used layer are compatible with a project version, a project can
# define a layer series name, and layers can specify to be compatible to one, or
# multiple, layer series.
#
# 7.4.2. Layer series compatibility
# We also need to specify that the tutorial layer is compatible with the
# bitbakeguilde. This can be done by setting LAYERSERIES_COMPAT_...
# variable in the in the layer.conf files of *each layer.*
#
# The variable ends on the layer name

# 7.5. Layer dependencies
# You might have noticed that we also specified the LAYERDEPENDS_two variable in
# the layer.conf file of our second layer, meta-two.
#
# By doing so we inform bitbake that this layer has a dependency to the tutorial
# layer. We well see in the next chapter, when we add more content to the
# meta-two layer, why this is the case.
