note: getaddrinfo takes long time in some network env so change its
preference.

One of the differences between getaddrinfo() and gethostbyname() is that the
former supports both IPv4 and IPv6, while the latter only supports IPv4. So
when you call getaddrinfo() with ai_family set to 0 (AF_UNSPEC), it won't
return until it gets a response (or hits a timeout) for both IPv4 and IPV6
queries. gethostbyname() only queries for an IPv4 record.  In forums, alos
mentioned the slower response from Ipv6 which will delay the getaddrinfo.
 
"In some network this assumption may cause some problems because most IPv6
connection right now is not as good as IPv4 (more lattency, etc.).  Sometimes
even cause serious problems because IPv6 link-local (address begin with
    ff80::) are considered valid IPv6 address.  Since current Linux
distributions shipped with IPv6 enabled (ipv6 modules loaded or compiled in),
some application failed to work if you do not have IPv6 connectivity or  at
  least slow to connect because IPv6 was attempt first and it timed out."

Thats I have already mentioned in the above comment. Looks like IPV6 response
is taking time which results in overall response delay.  We can change the
preference by /etc/gai.conf. I will share the SPK patch which have gai.conf
file to change the preference from IPV6 to IPV4 .  "precedence ::ffff:0:0/96
100"


GAI.CONF(5)               Linux Programmer's Manual              GAI.CONF(5)
NAME         top

       gai.conf - getaddrinfo(3) configuration file
DESCRIPTION         top

       A call to getaddrinfo(3) might return multiple answers.  According to
       RFC 3484 these answers must be sorted so that the answer with the
       highest success rate is first in the list.  The RFC provides an
       algorithm for the sorting.  The static rules are not always adequate,
       though.  For this reason, the RFC also requires that system
       administrators should have the possibility to dynamically change the
       sorting.  For the glibc implementation, this can be achieved with the
       /etc/gai.conf file.
