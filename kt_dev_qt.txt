|kt_dev_qt_0001| qt-edit-view

You can view multiple files simultaneously in the following ways:

To split the editor view into a top and bottom view, select Window > Split, press Ctrl+E, 2, or select the  (Split) button and then select Split.
Split command creates views below the currently active editor view.

To split the editor view into adjacent views, select Window > Split Side by Side, press Ctrl+E, 3, or select Split > Split Side by Side.
Side by side split command creates views to the right of the currently active editor view.

To open the editor in a detached window, press Ctrl+E, 4, or select Window > Open in New Window.
The new window behaves basically in the same way as the editor area in the main window. For example, you can split this window, as well. Documents are opened in the currently active editor window.

To move between split views and detached editor windows, select Window > Go to Next Split or Window or press Ctrl+E, O.

To remove a split view, place the cursor within the view you want to remove and select Window > Remove Current Split, press Ctrl+E, 0, or select the  (Remove Split) button. To remove all but the currently selected split view, select Window > Remove All Splits or press Ctrl+E, 1.

Externally Changed Files to update the code model.
