29.4. __main__ — Top-level script environment

'__main__' is the name of the `scope` in which top-level code executes. A
module’s __name__ is set equal to '__main__' when read from standard input, a
script, or from an interactive prompt.

A module can discover whether or not it is running in the `main-scope` by
checking its own __name__, which allows a common idiom for conditionally
executing code in a module when it is run `as-a-script` or with python -m but
not when it is imported:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # execute only if run as a script
    main()

For a package, the same effect can be achieved by including a __main__.py
module, the contents of which will be executed when the module is run with -m.

Python Scripts as a Replacement for Bash Utility Scripts

http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/python-scripts-replacement-bash-utility-scripts?page=0,0

Pros:

Python is a fully featured programming language. Code reuse is simple, because
Python modules easily can be imported and used in any Python script. Scripts
easily can be extended or built upon.

Python has access to an excellent standard library and thousands of third-party
libraries for all sorts of advanced utilities, such as parsers and request
libraries. For instance, Python's standard library includes datetime libraries
that allow you to parse dates into any format that you specify and compare it to
other dates easily. 

<ex>
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys

if __name__ == "__main__":

    # initialize a names dictionary as empty to start with.
    # each key in this dictionary will be a name and the value will be
    # the number of times that names appears. name-value-pair
    names = {}

    # sys.stdin is a file object. all the same functions that can be
    # applied to a file object can be applied to sys.stdin. 
    for name in sys.stdin.readlines():

        # each line will have a newline on the end that should be
        # removed.
        name = name.strip()

        if name in names:
            names[name] += 1
        else:
            names[name] = 1

    # iterating over the dictionary. print name followed by a space and 
    # the number of times it appeared.
    for name, count in names.iteritems():
        sys.stdout.write("%d\t%s\n" % (count, name))


$ cat names.log | python namescount.py


The standard library of Python provides a CSV reader. The Python script below
completes this goal:


*py-cvs-reader*

#!/usr/bin/env python
# CSV module that comes with the Python standard library
import csv
import sys

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # The CSV module exposes a reader object that takes
    # a file object to read. In this example, sys.stdin.
    csvfile = csv.reader(sys.stdin)

    # The script should take one argument that is a column number.
    # Command-line arguments are accessed via sys.argv list.
    column_number = 0
    if len(sys.argv) > 1:
            column_number = int(sys.argv[1])

    # Each row in the CSV file is a list with each 
    # comma-separated value for that line.
    for row in csvfile:
            print row[column_number]


*py-stmplib*

#!/usr/bin/env python
import smtplib
import sys


GMAIL_SMTP_SERVER = "smtp.gmail.com"
GMAIL_SMTP_PORT = 587

GMAIL_EMAIL = "Your Gmail Email Goes Here"
GMAIL_PASSWORD = "Your Gmail Password Goes Here"


def initialize_smtp_server():
    '''
    This function initializes and greets the smtp server.
    It logs in using the provided credentials and returns 
    the smtp server object as a result.
    '''
    smtpserver = smtplib.SMTP(GMAIL_SMTP_SERVER, GMAIL_SMTP_PORT)
    smtpserver.ehlo()
    smtpserver.starttls()
    smtpserver.ehlo()
    smtpserver.login(GMAIL_EMAIL, GMAIL_PASSWORD)
    return smtpserver


def send_thank_you_mail(email):
    to_email = email
    from_email = GMAIL_EMAIL
    subj = "Thanks for being an active commenter"
    # The header consists of the To and From and Subject lines
    # separated using a newline character
    header = "To:%s\nFrom:%s\nSubject:%s \n" % (to_email,
            from_email, subj)
    # Hard-coded templates are not best practice.
    msg_body = """
    Hi %s,

    Thank you very much for your repeated comments on our service.
    The interaction is much appreciated.

    Thank You.""" % email
    content = header + "\n" + msg_body
    smtpserver = initialize_smtp_server()
    smtpserver.sendmail(from_email, to_email, content)
    smtpserver.close()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # for every line of input.
    for email in sys.stdin.readlines():
            send_thank_you_mail(email)


*py-optionparser*

Thankfully, Python has a number of modules to deal with command-line arguments.
My personal favorite is OptionParser. OptionParser is part of the optparse
module that is provided by the standard library.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    usage = "usage: %prog [options]"
    parser = OptionParser(usage=usage)
    parser.add_option("--email", dest="email",
            help="email to login to smtp server")
    parser.add_option("--pwd", dest="pwd",
            help="password to login to smtp server")
    parser.add_option("--smtp-server", dest="smtpserver",
            help="smtp server url", default="smtp.gmail.com")
    parser.add_option("--smtp-port", dest="smtpserverport",
            help="smtp server port", default=587)
    options, args = parser.parse_args()

    if not (options.email or options.pwd):
            parser.error("Must provide both an email and a password")

    smtpserver = initialize_smtp_server(options.stmpserver,
            options.smtpserverport, options.email, options.pwd)

    # for every line of input.
    for email in sys.stdin.readlines():
            send_thank_you_mail(email, smtpserver)
    smtpserver.close()


There are a lot of aspects to Python in the shell that go beyond the scope of
  this article, such as the os module and the subprocess module. The os module
  is a standard library function that holds a lot of key operating system-level
  operations, such as listing directories and stating files, along with an
  excellent submodule os.path that deals with normalizing directories paths. The
  subprocess module allows Python programs to run system commands and other
  advanced operations, such as handling piping as described above within Python
  code between spawned processes. Both of these libraries are worth checking out
  if you intend to do any Python shell scripting.
