// appendix C A message-passing framework and complete ATM example
//
// Back in chapter 4, I presented an example of sending messages between threads
// using a message-passing framework, using a simple implementation of the code
// in an ATM as an example. What follows is the complete code for this example,
// including the message-passing framework.
//
// Listing C.1 shows the message queue. It stores a list of messages as pointers
// to a base class; the specific message type is handled with a template class
// derived from that base class. Pushing an entry constructs an appropriate
// instance of the wrapper class and stores a pointer to it; popping an entry
// returns that pointer. Because the message_base class doesnâ€™t have any member
// functions, the popping thread will need to cast the pointer to a suitable
// wrapped_message<T> pointer before it can access the stored message.
