34. Removing empty lines from a text file

Write a program that, given the path to a text file, modifies the file by
removing all empty lines. Lines containing only whitespaces are considered
empty.

A possible approach to solving this task is to do the following:

Create a temporary file to contain only the text you want to retain from the
original file

Read line by line from the input file and copy to the temporary file all lines
that are not empty
                            
Delete the original file after finishing processing it
    
Move the temporary file to the path of the original file
          
An alternative is to move the temporary file and overwrite the original one. The
following implementation follows the steps listed. The temporary file is created
in the temporary directory returned by filesystem::temp_directory_path():
