Algorithms and Data Structures

45. Priority queue

Write a data structure that represents a priority queue that provides constant
time lookup for the largest element, but has logarithmic time complexity for
adding and removing elements. A queue inserts new elements at the end and
removes elements from the top. By default, the queue should use operator< to
compare elements, but it should be possible for the user to provide a comparison
function object that returns true if the first argument is less than the second.
The implementation must provide at least the following operations:

push() to add a new element
pop() to remove the top element
top() to provide access to the top element
size() to indicate the number of elements in the queue
empty() to indicate whether the queue is empty

A priority queue is an abstract data type whose elements have a priority
attached to them. Instead of working as a first-in-first-out container, a
priority queue makes elements available in the order of their priority. This
data structure is used in algorithms such as Dijkstra's shortest path, Prim's
algorithm, heap sort, the A* search algorithm, in Huffman codes used for data
compression, and others.

A very simple approach to implement a priority queue would be to use an
std::vector as the underlying container of elements and always maintain it
sorted. That means the maximum and minimum elements are always at the two ends.
However, this approach does not provide the most efficient operations.

The most suitable data structure that can be used to implement a priority queue
is a heap. This is a tree-based data structure that satisfies the following
property: if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is either
greater than or equal to (in a max heap) or less than or equal to (in a min
heap) the key of C.

The standard library provides several operations for working with heaps:

std::make_heap(): This creates a max heap for the given range, using either
operator< or a user-provided comparison function to order the elements

std::push_heap(): This inserts a new element at the end of the max heap

std::pop_heap(): This removes the first element of the heap (by swapping the
values in the first and last position and making the sub-range [first, last-1) a
max heap)

A priority queue implementation, that uses std::vector to hold data and the
standard functions for heaps, can look as follows:

40. Number of days between two dates

Write a function that, given two dates, returns the number of days between the
two dates. The function should work regardless of the order of the input dates.

/*

41. Day of the week

Write a function that, given a date, determines the day of the week. This
function should return a value between 1 (for Monday) and 7 (for Sunday).

/*

42. Day and week of the year

Write a function that, given a date, returns the day of the year (from 1 to 365
or 366 for leap years) and another function that, for the same input, returns
the calendar week of the year.
