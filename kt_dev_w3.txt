*kt_dev_web_001* NPAPI

{js-to-native}
You can bundle an NPAPI plugin with your extension, allowing you to call into native binary code
from JavaScript. 

NPAPI is being phased out. Consider using alternatives. NPAPI is a really big hammer that should
only be used when no other approach will work. 

Code running in an NPAPI plugin has the full permissions of the current user and is not sandboxed or
shielded from malicious input by Google Chrome in any way. You should be especially cautious when
processing input from untrusted sources, such as when working with content scripts or
XMLHttpRequest. 

How to develop an NPAPI plugin is outside the scope of this document. See Mozilla's NPAPI plugin
reference for information on how to do that. 

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Plugins

<what-plugin-is>
Plugins are shared libraries that users can install to display content that the application itself
can't display natively. For example, the Adobe Reader plugin lets the user open PDF files directly
inside the browser, and the QuickTime and RealPlayer plugins are used to play special format videos
in a web page.

Plugins are now a legacy technology. They are not available on most mobile devices. Mozilla
encourages website developers to avoid using plugins wherever possible. If there are plugin features
which are not available in the web platform, we encourage developers to post their use cases to
mozilla.dev.platform project list, so that Mozilla can prioritize web platform work to make those
use cases possible.

Plugins are written using NPAPI, the cross-browser API for plugins. The main source of documentation
for NPAPI is the Gecko Plugin API Reference. To make your plugin scriptable from web pages, use
npruntime.

Plugins can be written completely from scratch using C APIs (usually in C or C++) or they may be
built on a plugin framework such as Firebreath, JUCE, or QtBrowserPlugin. There are also some code
generation tools that may be helpful. More information about these tools can be found on the
External Resources page.

Plugins are different from extensions, which modify or enhance the functionality of the browser
itself. Plugins are also different from search plugins, which plug additional search engines in the
search bar.

*kt_dev_web_002* url-encode

http://www.url-encode-decode.com/

What is URL encoding?

URL encoding stands for encoding 'certain' characters in a URL by replacing
them with one or more character triplets that consist of the percent character
"%" followed by two hexadecimal digits. The two hexadecimal digits of the
triplet(s) represent the numeric value of the replaced character.

For example, the string: François ,would be encoded as: Fran%C3%A7ois

The "ç" is encoded in UTF-8 as two bytes C3 (hex) and A7 (hex), which are then
written as the three characters "%c3" and "%a7" respectively. This can make a
URI rather long (up to 9 ASCII characters for a single Unicode character), but
the intention is that browsers only need to display the decoded form, and many
protocols can send UTF-8 without the %HH 'escaping'. 

The term URL encoding is a bit inexact because the encoding procedure is not
limited to URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), but can also be applied to any
other URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) such as URNs (Uniform Resource
    Names). Therefore, the term percent-encoding should be preferred. 


When and why would you use URL encoding?

When data that has been entered into HTML forms is submitted, the form field
names and values are encoded and sent to the server in an HTTP request message
using method GET or POST, or, historically, via email. The encoding used by
default is based on a very early version of the general URI percent-encoding
rules, with a number of modifications such as newline normalization and
replacing spaces with "+" instead of "%20". The MIME type of data encoded this
way is application/x-www-form-urlencoded, and it is currently defined (still
    in a very outdated manner) in the HTML and XForms specifications. In
addition, the CGI specification contains rules for how web servers decode data
of this type and make it available to applications.

When sent in an HTTP GET request, application/x-www-form-urlencoded data is
included in the query component of the request URI. When sent in an HTTP POST
request or via email, the data is placed in the body of the message, and the
name of the media type is included in the message's Content-Type header.

*kt_dev_web_003* qunit

https://qunitjs.com/intro/

You probably know that testing is good, but the first hurdle to overcome when
trying to write unit tests for client-side code is the lack of any actual units;
JavaScript code is written for each page of a website or each module of an
  application and is closely intermixed with back-end logic and related HTML. In
  the worst case, the code is completely mixed with HTML, as inline events
  handlers.

This is likely the case when no JavaScript library for some DOM abstraction is
being used; writing inline event handlers is much easier than using the DOM APIs
to bind those events. More and more developers are picking up a library such as
jQuery to handle the DOM abstraction, allowing them to move those inline events
to distinct scripts, either on the same page or even in a separate JavaScript
file. However, putting the code into separate files doesn’t mean that it is
ready to be tested as a unit.

What is a unit anyway? In the best case, it is a pure function that you can deal
with in some way - a function that always gives you the same result for a given
input. This makes unit testing pretty easy, but most of the time you need to
deal with side effects, which here means DOM manipulations. It's still useful to
figure out which units we can structure our code into and to build unit tests
accordingly.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing

1.  Introduction

   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless application-
   level request/response protocol that uses extensible semantics and
   self-descriptive message payloads for flexible interaction with
   network-based hypertext information systems.  This document is the
   first in a series of documents that collectively form the HTTP/1.1
   specification:

   1.  "Message Syntax and Routing" (this document)

   2.  "Semantics and Content" [RFC7231]

   3.  "Conditional Requests" [RFC7232]

   4.  "Range Requests" [RFC7233]

   5.  "Caching" [RFC7234]

   6.  "Authentication" [RFC7235]

   This HTTP/1.1 specification obsoletes RFC 2616 and RFC 2145 (on HTTP
   versioning).  This specification also updates the use of CONNECT to
   establish a tunnel, previously defined in RFC 2817, and defines the
   "https" URI scheme that was described informally in RFC 2818.

*kt_dev_web_005* user agent

YouView devices have a number of software components that use HTTP/1.1 to
communicate over the Internet. HTTP allows a User-Agent header field to be
included in the request. The purpose of the User-Agent header field is to
identify the application that made the request.

In order to allow servers to differentiate between requests from YouView devices
and requests from other HTTP clients, and to provide additional details about
device capabilities and versions, it is necessary to have a standard template
for User-Agent headers on YouView devices.

IETF, RFC 2616 – Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1, June 1999.

The design and construction of a User-Agent string for YouView must follow the
requirements of RFC 2616, which defines the form of the User-Agent string. In
addition, the UK DTG D-Book defines tokens which must be included in the
User-Agent string for requests relating to D-Book functionality.

HTTP/1.1 is defined in RFC 2616. The specification states that a User-Agent
header field should be included in the header of requests made. The header field
is formed of one or more product tokens, by convention listed in order of their
significance. The format is defined by the BNF grammar specified in RFC 2616 (in
        sections 14.43, 3.8 and 2.2), part of which is reproduced below.

User-Agent = “User-Agent” “:” 1*( product | comment )
product = token [ “/” product-version ]
product-version = token

That part of the header field following the initial “User-Agent: ” is referred
to here as the User-Agent string.

*kt_dev_web_005* cookie

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265

Abstract

   This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields.
   These header fields can be used by HTTP servers to store state
   (called cookies) at HTTP user agents, letting the servers maintain a
   stateful session over the mostly stateless HTTP protocol.  Although
   cookies have many historical infelicities that degrade their security
   and privacy, the Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields are widely used
   on the Internet.  This document obsoletes RFC 2965.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields.

   Using the `Set-Cookie header` field, an HTTP server can pass name/value
   pairs and associated `metadata` (called cookies) to a user agent.  When
   the user agent makes subsequent requests to the server, the user
   agent uses the metadata and other information to determine whether to
   return the name/value pairs in the `Cookie header`

   Although simple on their surface, cookies have a number of
   complexities.  For example, the server indicates a scope for each
   cookie when sending it to the user agent.  The scope indicates the
   maximum amount of time in which the user agent should `return` the
   cookie, the servers to which the user agent should return the cookie,
   and the URI schemes for which the cookie is applicable.

3.  Overview

   This section outlines a way for an origin server to send state
   information to a user agent and for the user agent to return the
   state information to the origin server.

   To store state, the origin server includes a `Set-Cookie header` in an
   `HTTP response`  In subsequent requests, the user agent returns a
   Cookie request header to the origin server.  The `Cookie header`
   contains cookies the user agent received in previous Set-Cookie
   headers.  The origin server is free to ignore the Cookie header or
   use its contents for an application-defined purpose.

   == Server -> User Agent ==

   Set-Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42

   == User Agent -> Server ==

   Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42

   The server can `alter the default scope` of the cookie using the Path
   and Domain attributes.  For example, the server can instruct the user
   agent to return the cookie to every path and every subdomain of
   example.com.

   == Server -> User Agent ==

   Set-Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42; Path=/; Domain=example.com

   == User Agent -> Server ==

   Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42

   As shown in the next example, the server can store `multiple cookies`
   at the user agent.  For example, the server can store a session
   identifier as well as the user's preferred language by returning two
   Set-Cookie header fields.  Notice that the server uses the Secure and
   HttpOnly attributes to provide additional security protections for
   the more sensitive session identifier (see Section 4.1.2.)

   == Server -> User Agent ==

   Set-Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly
   Set-Cookie: lang=en-US; Path=/; Domain=example.com

   == User Agent -> Server ==

   Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42; lang=en-US

   Notice that the Cookie header above contains two cookies, one named
   SID and one named lang.  If the server wishes the user agent to
   persist the cookie `over multiple "sessions"` (e.g., user agent
   restarts), the server can specify an `expiration date` in the Expires
   attribute.

   ...

   Finally, to remove a cookie, the server returns a Set-Cookie header
   with an expiration date in the past.  The server will be successful
   in removing the cookie only if the Path and the Domain attribute in
   the Set-Cookie header match the values used when the cookie was
   created.

5.2.  The Set-Cookie Header

5.4.  The Cookie Header

   The user agent includes stored cookies in the Cookie HTTP request
   header.

   When the user agent generates an HTTP request, the user agent MUST
   NOT attach more than one Cookie header field.

7.3.  Expiration Dates

   Although servers can set the expiration date for cookies to the
   distant future, most user agents do not actually retain cookies for
   multiple decades.  Rather than choosing gratuitously long expiration
   periods, servers SHOULD promote user privacy by selecting reasonable
   cookie expiration periods based on the purpose of the cookie.  For
   example, a typical session identifier might reasonably be set to
   expire in two weeks.

*kt_dev_web_005* w3-cgi

A CGI (Common Gateway Interface) is a program that runs on a web server. CGIs
are typically called from HTML forms, and usually are designed to run quickly
and return an HTML page someone can use in a browser. 

A CGI script can be written in any language that can read STDIN, write to
STDOUT, and read environment variables, i.e. virtually any programming
language, including C, Perl, or even shell scripting


http://<hostname>/cgi-bin/example-bash.sh

<ex>
#!/bin/bash

# These two lines tell your browser that the rest of the content comming from
# the program is HTML, and should be treated as such. Leaving these lines out
# will often cause your browser to download the output of the program to disk
# as a text file instead of displaying it, since it doesn't understand that it
# is HTML!

echo "Content-type: text/html"
echo ""

# This program uses the echo program to send text to a browser. If you can
# read from STDIN and write to STDOUT, then you can write CGI scripts.

echo "<html><head><title>Welcome</title></head>"
echo "<body>"
echo "Welcome to your Bash CGI!"
echo "</body></html>"

<ex>
#!/bin/bash
echo "Content-type: text/html"
echo ''
echo 'CGI Bash Example'

<ex>
#!/bin/bash
echo "Content-type: text/html"
echo ''
echo 'CGI Bash example<br>'
echo `df -h / | grep -v Filesystem`

<ex>
$ sudo gcc -o /usr/lib/cgi-bin/example-c example-c.c
http://cgi-example.local/cgi-bin/example-c

#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
  printf("Content-Type: text/plain \n\n");
  printf("CGI C Example \n");
}


{process-data}
HTML form that `submits` data to a CGI program

<form action="http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/example.sh" method="get">
Enter a username: <input type="text" name="username"></input><br>
<input type="radio" name="whatToDo" value="remove" checked="checked">Value<br>
<input type="radio" name="whatToDo" value="create">Create<br>
<input type="submit" name="subbtn" value="Submit">
<form> 

Assuming the user entered "John Doe" into the text box and selected the
"create" radio button. 

CGI program sees the data submitted from this form, it sees something like
this:

username=John Doe
whatToDo=create
subbtn=Submit

CGI program that does something with this data. Below is a simple Bash program
that will tell the user what they entered:

// cgi-bin/example.sh
#!/bin/bash

echo "Content-type: text/html"
echo ""

# replaces any occurances of %20 with a space, since when the form data is
# transfered from the browser to the server, spaces are turned into %20 (so
# "Hi there" becomes "Hi%20there"). 

USERNAME=`echo "$QUERY_STRING" | sed -n 's/^.*username=\([^&]*\).*$/\1/p' | sed "s/%20/ /g"
WHATTODO=`echo "$QUERY_STRING" | sed -n 's/^.*whatToDo=\([^&]*\).*$/\1/p' | sed "s/%20/ /g"
echo "<html><head><title>What You Said</title></head>"
echo "<body>Here's what you said:
echo "You entered $USERNAME for username and wanted the action to be $ACTION.
echo "</body></html>"


Since the form uses the GET method to transmit data, the web server takes the
data it receives from the form and puts it in an enviromental variable named
`QUERY_STRING`. It then starts the CGI program referenced in the form, which is
our Bash program.

Script receives the form data as a set of name-value pairs. This set of
name-value pairs is given to you as one long string, which you need to parse. 

The long string is in one of these two formats:

"name1=value1&name2=value2&name3=value3"
"name1=value1;name2=value2;name3=value3" 

So just split on the ampersands or semicolons, then on the equal signs. Then,
   do two more things to each name and value:

Convert all "+" characters to spaces, and
Convert all "%xx" sequences to the single character whose ascii value is "xx",
        in hex. For example, convert "%3d" to "=". 

This is needed because the original long string is URL-encoded, to allow for
equal signs, ampersands, and so forth in the user's input.

So where do you get the long string? That depends on the HTTP method the form
was submitted with:

For GET submissions, it's in the environment variable QUERY_STRING.
For POST submissions, read it from STDIN. The exact number of bytes to read is
in the environment variable CONTENT_LENGTH. 


{post-and-get}
GET data is sent as part of the URL. You may notice when browsing URLs such as
this nicely color-coded example: 

http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/myProgram.sh?action=buy&item=Big%20Table&price=32.99&sub=Submit

GET data is identified by a `?` after the CGI that will handle the data. The
data is made up of the form form_element_name=value separated by ampersands
(&). 

In the example above, we see that an HTML form contained elements named
"action", "item", "price", and "sub" and their values were "buy", "Big Table"
, "32.99", and "Submit". 


<nice-thing-about-get>
One nice thing about GET data is that it doesn't necessarily have to come from
an HTML form. Since it is simply part of a URL, you can create links to CGI
scripts that accept GET data and simple pass the data you want to the program
in the URL of the link, without having to create a form and have the user
click "submit."

For example, say I had a CGI program that displayed a page that showed either
the date or time, depending on what something called "whatToShow" equaled. If
"whatToShow" equals "date" it shows the date, if it equals "time" it shows the
time. One way to access this CGI would be to create an HTML form and have the
user submit this, as shown below:

<form action="myprogram.sh" method="get">
What do you want to do?<br>
<input type="radio" name="whatToDo" value="date">Show the Date<br>
<input type="radio" name="whatToDo" value="time">Show the Time<br>
<input type="submit" name="submit" value="Go">
</form>

Alternatively, since GET data is just part of the URL, I could just create two
links to the CGI, one for the date and one for the time, and get the same
result, but with less typing and a different look:

<a href="myprogram.sh?whatToDo=date">Show the Date</a><br>
<a href="myprogram.sh?whatToDo=time">Show the Time</a>


This trick is very useful for times when your CGI program only accepts some
simple, predefined input that doesn't require a whole form to get, and you
want the user to access the CGI by just clicking a link, instead of having to
fill out and submit an entire form. 


This trick is also useful for debugging CGIs that accept GET data: you can
keep running them with different data without having to keep changing your
HTML form; just change the URL to make the new data you want to submit your
CGI. 


<get-drawbacks>

* It can only send a limited amount of data. URLs (and GET itself) are limited
  in how long they can be, and this limits how much data GET can send.

* The data sent in GET is clearly visible in the URL. While this is great for
  debugging, it may be undesirable in the final product.

* GET can't send any type of data. Its limited to regular characters. So, you
  can't upload files with GET (it would be impracticable to do this given the
  limit on the amount of data you can send with GET, anyway).


Fortunately, an alternative to GET exists which solves most of these problems:
POST. POST data is not sent as part of the URL. Instead, it is sent as its own
separate stream. POST can send any type of data, can send any amount of data
(no limitations of the amount of data like with GET), and the data isn't
easily visible to the user in the URL.

*kt_dev_web_005* w3-php

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/php/php_get_post.htm

There are two ways the browser client can send information to the web server.

    The GET Method
    The POST Method

Before the browser sends the information, it encodes it using a scheme called
URL encoding. In this scheme, name/value pairs are joined with equal signs and
different pairs are separated by the ampersand.

name1=value1&name2=value2&name3=value3

Spaces are removed and replaced with the + character and any other
nonalphanumeric characters are replaced with a hexadecimal values. After the
information is encoded it is sent to the server.  


The GET Method

The GET method sends the encoded user information appended to the page
request. The page and the encoded information are separated by the ?
character.

http://www.test.com/index.htm?name1=value1&name2=value2

    The GET method produces a long string that appears in your server logs, in
    the browser's Location: box.

    The GET method is restricted to send upto 1024 characters only.

    Never use GET method if you have password or other sensitive information
    to be sent to the server.

    GET can't be used to send binary data, like images or word documents, to
    the server.

    The data sent by GET method can be accessed using QUERY_STRING environment
    variable.

    The PHP provides $_GET associative array to access all the sent
    information using GET method.

Try out following example by putting the source code in test.php script.

<?php
   if( $_GET["name"] || $_GET["age"] ) {
      echo "Welcome ". $_GET['name']. "<br />";
      echo "You are ". $_GET['age']. " years old.";
      
      exit();
   }
?>
<html>
   <body>
   
      <form action = "<?php $_PHP_SELF ?>" method = "GET">
         Name: <input type = "text" name = "name" />
         Age: <input type = "text" name = "age" />
         <input type = "submit" />
      </form>
      
   </body>

http://php.net/manual/en/function.touch.php

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)
touch — Sets access and modification time of file

Description

bool touch ( string $filename [, int $time = time() [, int $atime ]] )

Attempts to set the access and modification times of the file named in the
filename parameter to the value given in time. Note that the access time is
always modified, regardless of the number of parameters.

If the file does not exist, `it will be created`


http://php.net/manual/en/function.header.php

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)
header — Send a raw HTTP header

Description

void header ( string $string [, bool $replace = true [, int $http_response_code ]] )

header() is used to send a raw HTTP header. See the » HTTP/1.1 specification
for more information on HTTP headers.

Remember that header() must be called before any actual output is sent, either
  by normal HTML tags, blank lines in a file, or from PHP. It is a very common
  error to read code with include, or require, functions, or another file
  access function, and have spaces or empty lines that are output before
  header() is called. The same problem exists when using a single PHP/HTML
  file.

<html>
<?php
/* This will give an error. Note the output
 * above, which is before the header() call */
header('Location: http://www.example.com/');
exit;
?>


http://php.net/manual/en/function.file-put-contents.php

(PHP 5, PHP 7)
file_put_contents — Write a string to a file

Description

int file_put_contents ( string $filename , mixed $data [, int $flags = 0 [, resource $context ]] )

This function is identical to calling fopen(), fwrite() and fclose()
successively to write data to a file.

If filename does not exist, the file is created. Otherwise, the existing file
is overwritten, unless the FILE_APPEND flag is set.

*kt_dev_web_005* dropbox

https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/201

Force a file or folder to download, or to render on dropbox.com

You can make simple modifications to Dropbox links to share files the way you
want.  Force a file or folder to download

To force a browser to download a file or folder rather than display it, you
can use dl=1 as a query parameter in your URL. For example:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/a1b2c3d4ef5gh6/example.docx?dl=1

Note: The original shared link URL may contain query string parameters already
      (for example, dl=0). App developers should be sure to properly parse the
      URL and add or modify parameters as needed.
